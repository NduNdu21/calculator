# calculator

This is a calculator project as part of TheOdinProject foundations course.
For this project I used HTML, CSS and Javascript. The calculator is basic with functionality for the 4 common operands (+, -, /, *).

I had challenges with the Javascript logic but with the help of W3schools and ChatGPT to understand my errors, I was able to complete a functioning calculator.
